# Brandon Crow - Data Solutions Portfolio

I'm **Brandon Crow**—a data professional who transforms complex data challenges into **elegant, automated solutions**. I specialize in building robust tools with **Python** and **SQL** that streamline processes, ensure data quality, and scale with business needs. This portfolio showcases hands-on, production-inspired projects that demonstrate my ability to solve real-world data problems with clean, well-documented code.

Each project here is a **real-world solution** I’ve built to tackle messy data problems. You’ll find:
- **Practical tools**: From ETL pipelines to fuzzy matching and document automation.
- **Production-grade code**: Clean, modular, and tested, with anonymized data.
- **Clear documentation**: Detailed READMEs and example outputs for easy understanding.
